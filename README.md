# open-data-excuses

<p>This is a prototype open data excuses site inspired by <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/">yourlogicalfallacyis.com</a>. I thought a site like this could include common open data excuses and their rebuttals, with nice handy urls for each one.</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/chriswhong/open-data-excuses/">Github</a>.  I need help with content & design.  Please consider contributing!  This site was made using the gatsbyjs static site generator.</p>
